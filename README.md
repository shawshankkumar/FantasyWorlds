# FantasyWorlds
I wrote this in the SFB editor. It is an alexa game where you visit multiple planets and fantasy worlds. Currently there are just three, Arrakis from Frank Herbert's Dune, Westeros from GOT and Hogwarts from Harry potter. You fight monsters and villains from these worlds and using the dice roll, you either win or you die.
